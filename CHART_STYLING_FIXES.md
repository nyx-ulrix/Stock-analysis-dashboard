# Chart Styling Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Chart Container Sizing Issues**

-   **Problem**: Charts had fixed heights that didn't fit properly in containers
-   **Solution**:
    -   Removed fixed height from outer containers
    -   Added proper responsive containers with `min-h-*` classes
    -   Used `ResponsiveContainer` properly with defined height containers

### 2. **Overlapping Elements**

-   **Problem**: Chart elements were overlapping due to improper spacing
-   **Solution**:
    -   Increased spacing between sections (`space-y-8` instead of `space-y-6`)
    -   Added proper margins (`mb-6` instead of `mb-4`)
    -   Improved grid gaps (`gap-6` instead of `gap-4`)

### 3. **Responsive Design Issues**

-   **Problem**: Charts not responsive on different screen sizes
-   **Solution**:
    -   Updated grid layouts: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`
    -   Added proper responsive chart containers
    -   Improved mobile layout with better breakpoints

### 4. **Layout Container Issues**

-   **Problem**: Main container not properly constrained
-   **Solution**:
    -   Added `max-w-7xl` to main container
    -   Improved overall layout structure
